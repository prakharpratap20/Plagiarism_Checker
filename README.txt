## Plagiarism Detection Script Documentation

### Introduction
This script is designed to perform plagiarism detection on a collection of text documents using the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization technique and cosine similarity metric. It calculates the similarity between pairs of text documents and identifies potential instances of plagiarism.

### Prerequisites
1. Python: Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Required Libraries: This script uses the `os` module for file operations and the `sklearn` library for TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity calculations.

### Usage
1. Place the script in the directory containing the text files you want to analyze for plagiarism.
2. Run the script using a Python interpreter (e.g., `python plagiarism_detector.py`).

### Script Overview
The script follows these main steps:

1. **File Loading and Text Extraction:**
    - It retrieves a list of text files present in the same directory as the script.
    - For each text file, it reads the content and stores it in the `user_notes` list.

2. **Vectorization Function:**
    - The `vectorize` function takes a list of text documents as input and converts them into TF-IDF vectors using the `TfidfVectorizer` class from `sklearn`.
    - It returns a matrix of TF-IDF vectors corresponding to the input text documents.

3. **Similarity Calculation Function:**
    - The `similarity` function calculates the cosine similarity between two input vectors.
    - It uses the `cosine_similarity` function from `sklearn.metrics.pairwise` module.
    - The function returns the cosine similarity score between the two input vectors.

4. **Vectorization of User Notes:**
    - The script vectorizes the `user_notes` using the `vectorize` function, resulting in a matrix of TF-IDF vectors representing each document.

5. **Plagiarism Detection:**
    - The script creates pairs of text documents and calculates their similarity scores using the `similarity` function.
    - If the similarity score between two documents exceeds a certain threshold, they are considered potential instances of plagiarism.
    - The script generates a set of plagiarism results containing tuples of the form `(document1, document2, similarity_score)`.

6. **Plagiarism Check Function:**
    - The `check_plagiarism` function iterates through each document and its corresponding TF-IDF vector.
    - For each document, it calculates the similarity with all other documents and adds potential plagiarism pairs to the `plagiarism_results` set.
    - The function returns the set of plagiarism results.

Please note that the current implementation of the `check_plagiarism` function might have a logic issue: the `return` statement is placed within the first iteration of the outer loop, potentially causing the function to terminate prematurely.

### Conclusion
This script provides a basic framework for performing plagiarism detection using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity. However, you might need to review and potentially modify parts of the code to ensure accurate results and proper functionality.
